# Defining Paraglider Project Maintainers

## Finding all the Paraglider projects
You can see all of the repositories associated with Paraglider by navigating to the top-level Paraglider organization on GitHub. For now, there is only one repository.

## Who are the current maintainers?
The maintainers for each Paraglider project are contained in the CODEOWNERS file in the respective repository (note that the CODEOWNERS file may refer to a github team name, which is public under the Paraglider GitHub organization). 

## Removing a maintainer from a project
There are many reasons why a maintainer may need to leave a project. In the case that one does, please follow the steps under maintainer changes process.

## Adding a maintainer for a project
All projects should ideally have multiple maintainers (as listed in the relevant CODEOWNERS file(s)). There currently are no upper limits set on the number of maintainers for a Paraglider project. A project will have as many maintainers as it sees are useful for the functioning of the project and its community. To add a maintainer to a Paraglider project, please follow the steps under maintainer changes process

## Maintainer Changes Process

1. Open an issue in the repo describing the necessary change.
2. Create a pull request (PR) in the repo, making the necessary change to the CODEOWNERS file. This PR must be linked to the issue.
3. Add an item about the maintainer change to the agenda for the next Paraglider TSC meeting.
4. Discuss the change in the meeting.
5. If the TSC approves (by majority vote of all present TSC members or their proxies), merge the PR. If they do not approve, close the PR without merging or continue the discussion with the TSC as necessary.
NO MAINTAINER CHANGES ARE VALID WITHOUT TSC APPROVAL.

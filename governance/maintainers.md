# Defining Paraglider Project Maintainers

## Finding all the Paraglider projects
You can see all of the repositories associated with Paraglider by navigating to the top-level Paraglider organization on GitHub.

## Who are the current maintainers?
The maintainers for each Paraglider project are contained in the CODEOWNERS file in the respective repository (note that the CODEOWNERS file may refer to a github team name, which is public under the Paraglider GitHub organization). 

## Removing a maintainer from a project
There are many reasons why a maintainer may need to leave a project. In the case that one does, please follow the steps [here](role-changes.md).

## Adding a maintainer for a project
All projects should ideally have multiple maintainers (as listed in the relevant CODEOWNERS file(s)). There currently are no upper limits set on the number of maintainers for a Paraglider project. A project will have as many maintainers as it sees are useful for the functioning of the project and its community. To add a maintainer to a Paraglider project, please follow the steps for role changes [here](role-changes.md).

# Role Changes

## Removal from a Project Role
A person may voluntarily resign from a project role by making a public announcement to the TSC.
A person in a project role who is disruptive, or has been inactive on that project for an extended period (e.g., six or more months), or is not abiding by the project charter or code of conduct may have his or her role status revoked by the TSC.
Disputes are resolved by TSC voting (majority).

# Role Changes Process
1. Open an issue in the repo describing the necessary change.
2. Create a pull request (PR) in the repo, making the necessary change to the CODEOWNERS or governance documentation file. This PR must be linked to the issue.
3. Add an item about the maintainer change to the agenda for the next Paraglider TSC meeting.
4. Discuss the change in the meeting.
5. If the TSC approves (by majority vote of all present TSC members or their proxies), merge the PR. If they do not approve, close the PR without merging or continue the discussion with the TSC as necessary.
NO MAINTAINER CHANGES ARE VALID WITHOUT TSC APPROVAL.

# Technical Steering Committee (TSC) Procedures
## TSC Membership
Membership changes to the Paraglider TSC is governed by the current list of TSC members with voting rights. TSC membership changes require a majority vote by the current TSC members in order to pass. For more details on TSC voting procedures please refer to the Paraglider Technical Charter "TSC Voting" section.

## Adding TSC Members
In order to have a vote on adding a new member to the Paraglider TSC a github issue should be opened against the repository and tagged with the “governance” label. The title of the issue should be TSC New Member - <NAME> with a description on why this person should be added to the TSC. The opened github issue should then be referenced in the next TSC meeting which will determine a date to conduct a vote on the new membership. If a vote does not occur within a 1-month period from opening the issue the motion will be considered denied, and the issue will be closed.

## Removal of TSC Members
To request removal of a TSC member open a github issue with the “governance” label and with the title TSC "Membership Removal - <NAME>".

Existing TSC members can request their own removal from the Paraglider TSC at anytime and the issue will be taken up in the next weekly TSC meeting. The person will then be removed as a TSC member. If there is a proposed replacement for the member leaving, they should be mentioned in the removal issue. The proposed replacement member should open a new github issue and follow the Adding TSC Members section.

Removal of a TSC member can be requested by other TSC members or from the community with a description on why they should be removed listed in the issue. Examples of reasons for removal could be lack of activity of that TSC member for a prolonged period of time. Requests for removal will be discussed in the next weekly TSC meeting and a date will be determined for a vote on the membership removal.

Please DO NOT report Code of Conduct issues here and instead follow the reporting procedures defined in the Paraglider Project Code of Conduct.

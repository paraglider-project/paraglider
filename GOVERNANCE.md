Additional roles, including Project Technical Leads (PTLs) may be defined as project needs arise.

Additional project roles, as needed, are filled by TSC voting (majority).

A person in a project role who is disruptive, or has been inactive on that project for an extended period (e.g., six or more months), or is not abiding by the project charter or code of conduct may have his or her role status revoked by the TSC.
